# AlgoLabs: Linux terminal labs

You do every lab inside a **GitHub Codespace** of this repository. You don't need to install anything on your computer: a browser is enough.

**[Open AlgoLabs in a Codespace](https://codespaces.new/xDarkPhoneix/AlgoLabs?quickstart=1)** All labs are graded on the class **lab server**. You log in to the server from the Codespace terminal with the private SSH key from your personal access ZIP.

Your access ZIP comes from your instructor's email, for example `Lab_4_student07_Access.zip`. One ZIP works for **every** lab. Keep it private: the file `access/ssh_key` inside it is your private key, and anyone who has it can log in as you.

## Lab 5: step by step

In every step below, replace `studentNN` with your own account, for example `student07`. Your account is in your ZIP's name and in the email.

> **Your private key is a file:** `access/ssh_key`. You give SSH the file's **location** with `-i`. Do **not** open the key and paste its text into the terminal: that fails and exposes your key.

**1. Open your Codespace.** Click this link and choose **Create new codespace** (if you already have one, choose **Resume this codespace**):

**[Open AlgoLabs in a Codespace](https://codespaces.new/xDarkPhoneix/AlgoLabs?quickstart=1)**

You can also open it from this repository's GitHub page: **Code → Codespaces**. Wait until the editor and a terminal appear at the bottom. If there is no terminal, open one with **Terminal → New Terminal** (or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>`</kbd>).

**2. Upload your access ZIP.** In the Explorer on the left, right-click the `.uploads` folder, choose **Upload…** and pick the ZIP from your email. You can also drag the ZIP onto the `.uploads` folder. Keep it zipped.

**3. Unzip it into your home folder.** Run this in the terminal:

```bash
unzip -o .uploads/Lab_4_studentNN_Access.zip -d ~
cd ~/Lab_4_studentNN_Access
ls access
```

`ls access` must list `ssh_key`. Your home folder (`~`) is outside the repository, so the key can never be committed to Git by mistake.

**4. Protect your key.** SSH refuses a key that other users can read:

```bash
chmod 600 access/ssh_key
```

**5. Connect to the lab server.** Your ZIP's `README.md` has this exact command with your account already filled in:

```bash
ssh -i access/ssh_key studentNN@98.70.53.61
```

The first time, SSH asks `Are you sure you want to continue connecting?`. Type `yes` only if the fingerprint shown matches the one in your ZIP's `README.md`. You are connected when the prompt shows `studentNN@students-lab:~$`.

**6. Do the lab on the server:**

```bash
cd ~/lab-work/lab5          # your Lab 5 folder: sample data and README.md are here
check_lab lab5              # see your score at any time
```

Follow [labs/lab5/Lab_Book.md](labs/lab5/Lab_Book.md). You can keep it open in the Codespace editor next to the terminal. The same instructions are also in `README.md` in your server folder. Each part ends with a **✅ Check** box that tells you which evidence files to save. Type `exit` to disconnect. Your files stay on the server.

> Once you are connected, the prompt shows `studentNN@students-lab`, and every command you type runs **on the lab server**, not in the Codespace. Check the prompt if you are unsure where you are.

---

## Check your score

```bash
check_lab lab5      # on the server: name the lab
```

- Grading runs on the server, and the tests are hidden.
- You can check as often as you like. Every attempt is recorded for your instructor.
- Checking never changes your files.
- Read the **FAIL** lines: each one names the ✅ Check it belongs to.

## Coming back later

Your lab work is saved on the server, not in the Codespace.

- **Same Codespace:** open the [Codespace link](https://codespaces.new/xDarkPhoneix/AlgoLabs?quickstart=1) and choose **Resume this codespace**, then run:

  ```bash
  cd ~/Lab_4_studentNN_Access
  ssh -i access/ssh_key studentNN@98.70.53.61
  ```

- **New or rebuilt Codespace**, or `cd` says `No such file or directory`: repeat steps 2 to 5. Your work on the server is still there.

| `REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED`                                                                                 | Stop. Do not type `yes` or delete anything. Send the exact message to your instructor.                                             |
| Connection lost, frozen terminal, or the Codespace stopped                                                               | Open a new terminal and connect again (see [Coming back later](#coming-back-later)). Saved files are kept.                         |
| `Host key verification failed` or `Permission denied (publickey)`                                                        | Do not change any SSH settings. Send the exact error to your instructor (**never** send your key or ZIP).                          |

## Rules

- Use only **your own** ZIP, account and roll number.
- Never commit, share or post your ZIP or key. The `.uploads` folder is kept out of Git, and your unzipped key lives outside the repository.
- Work only on your own lab files. Do not use `sudo`.
